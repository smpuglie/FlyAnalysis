%% Script to empty folders of videos. 
% Once videos are analysed, either for the leg kinematics or for probe
% position, they can be deleted from B\:. QuickShow can then take you to
% the actual location, regardless of where they may be, but alerts you that
% the movie is in a different folder.

%% Go to every folder in B\:Raw_Data

%% Go to every cell

%% check if the trial has a video file

% If so is it correct? Name, trial name, date, entered in the data file?

% Is the movie in the folder?
    
    % If not, 
        % check the logical place (E:\)
        % Is the flag checked in the trial and has it been analysed?
        
            % NOTE FAILURE
    
    % If it's there,

        % If so, has it been analysed?
            % Is there a forceprobestuff vector?
            % Is there a leg kinematics structure?
            
                % If so, move the movie over, note that it has been moved in the trial
